## What is biodiesel?
Biodiesel is an ester of fatty acids from animal or plant oils resulting from its reaction with alcohol aided by catalyst. In simple term, it is a fuel derived from plants and/or animals which can replace or can blend with diesel.  It can be derived from all sorts of plant oils like coconut, jatropha, peanut, soya, corn, sunflower, canola or rapeseed, avocado, palm, shea butter, etc. It can also be produced from animal fats like from lechon manok, lechon etc. Anyway, all reactions are termed “ transesterification reaction” wherein oil reacts with alcohol like methanol or ethanol to produce 3 moles of biodiesel and one mole of glycerine. The reaction is aided by heat and catalyst like sodium or potassium hydroxide. If the alcohol used is methanol, the biodiesel is called methyl ester and if ethanol is used, it is called ethyl ester. By international convention, the source of the oil is attached as suffix to the ester, say if the oil is derived from soya, the biodiesel is called soya methyl ester or from coconut it is called coco methyl ester. There are also existing study that algae can likewise produce biodiesel.   

## What is coconut methy ester or CME?
CME is the acronym for Coconut Methyl Ester or Coco-Biodiesel. Biodiesel, on the other hand, is the international name for methyl ester when used as diesel fuel or enhancer. (CME is not the same as the coco-diesel used in the 70's. Coco-diesel pertains to the use of crude coconut oil. Unlike Coco-Biodiesel this crude coconut oil did not undergo transestherification.)

The properties of Coco-Biodiesel result in more efficient combustion that translates to increased engine power, longer mileage, and less emission.

## Is Coco-Biodiesel safe to use on my engine?
YES! Coco-Biodiesel can be used in any diesel engine with little or no modification to the engine or fuel system. Also, blending Coco-Biodiesel actually improves the quality of the diesel fuel because of its properties like:

1. High lubricity, which protects your engine from wear.
2. Detergency, which cleans your fuel system.
3. Solvency, which dissolves and cleans you combustion chamber from carbon deposits.

## How do I mix Coco-Biodiesel?
Simply add a 1% equivalent of Coco-Biodiesel to the fuel you are loading into your tank. For example, if you are loading 50 liters of diesel fuel, add 500 ml of Coco-Biodiesel. If you are refilling only 10 liters add only 100 ml of Coco-Biodiesel.

## Why only 1%?
While the World Fuel Charter published by all automotive manufacturers worldwide allows blends of up to 5%, studies show that a 1% mix of Coco-Biodiesel is enough to significantly reduce emissions.

## Won't the use of Coco-Biodiesel increase my spending on fuel?
Initially, it would appear that way. But think about this. Since you will gain more mileage per liter with the use of Coco-Biodiesel, your savings will amount to about P1 per additional kilometer traveled. In short, Coco-Biodiesel doubles the value of your fuel investment.

## Is there a law prohibiting the use of B100?
There is no such law. You may produce your biodiesel backyard and used it 100%. However, if you’re going to sell it commercially, you will have to abide by the law like certifications from DOE ( EUMB ), have your biodiesel approved by PNS or Philippine National Standards ( 2020:2003 ). Biofuel Act of 2006 likewise allows only 1 % blend right now and 2 % blend by 2010. 

## Where can I buy Coco-Biodiesel?
You can buy Coco-Biodiesel from distribution outlets and manufacturers/suppliers accredited by the Department of Energy (DOE). These DOE-Accredited outlets and suppliers sell Coco-Biodiesel that complies with Philippine National Standards (PNS 2020:2003). Flying V is one of them. In addition, these manufacturers and suppliers have assured DOE of Coco-Biodiesel's continuous supply.

## Is Coco-Biodiesel the solution to all fuel-related engine and emission problems of my vehicle?
Coco-Biodiesel is just one of the solutions to pollution and emission problems. To ensure optimum engine performance, a vehicle owner or driver should still carry out regular maintenance and practice good driving habits.

## Is Coco-Biodiesel here to stay?
Coco-Biodiesel is a priority project of the DOE, DOST and Office of the President. It is being implemented by DOE in collaboration with several government agencies: the Department of Environment & Natural Resources (DENR), Department of Science & Technology (DOST), Department of Transportation & Communications (DOTC), Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA), Department of Trade & Industry (DTI), and Department of Finance (DOF). It is likewise supported by the Technological University of the Philippines (TUP), Asian Institute of Petroleum Studies Inc. (AIPSI), and other academic and research institutions, transport groups, NGOs, and donor communities.

In addition, the critical step of instituting Coco-Biodiesel was taken by the President of the Republic of the Philippines by issuing Memorandum Circular No. 55 on February 9, 2004 "directing all departments, bureaus, offices, agencies and instrumentalities of the government, including government-owned and controlled corporations to incorporate the use of one percent (1%) by volume Coconut Methyl Ester in their diesel requirements."

With all the benefits of Coco-Biodiesel and with all the support that it is getting, we can be assured that it will be a sustainable and strategic approach in cleaning the air and energizing the economy.

## Why do people claim that Biodiesel clogs filters?
The short answer is that in a new engine (or more precisely a new fuel tank) it won't clog filters. The longer answer and the one that is more applicable for users who are "converting" to biodiesel is this. Over time fossil diesel will leave deposits in your tank and fuel line and as Biodiesel is mixed with this, it will quickly break it down and move it forward, typically towards your engine. Please be aware that you must anticipate this when considering Biodiesel, but don't fear it. A filter is very cheap and easy to install and replace. You will usually only need it for 2-3 tanks of fuel depending on the blend of your Biodiesel.

## Can I mix biodiesel with petro diesel?
This is most often question, Yes, it can be blended in any ratio, and yes you can run your vehicle on 100% biodiesel!

## Do I have to make any changes to my vehicle to run biodiesel?
No, biodiesel will power anything that runs on regular diesel, in fact it will remove fuel deposits and buildup that is already in your fuel lines, tank, and engine from using petro diesel. That is why when making the transition from petro diesel to biodiesel, care for the fuel filters should be taken.

## What is the by-product of making biodiesel?
The by-product of making biodiesel is Glycerin; it is typically a dark substance that will solidify over time. When cleaned ( ask me how ) it turned clear liquid. Purified glycerin have many uses, if you ‘ll look at the ingredients of your cosmetics, its most of the time there. This is because its good for the skin as emollient, humectants and moisturizer. Highly purified glycerin is also a sweetener. It 60 % less sweet than table sugar. Its also being used as cleaner specially during your car maintenance and repair. Even raw glycerin can easily removed grease and oils. Its also the raw material for so many other products like explosives, foam, soap, handwash, skin disinfectant etc. 

You can also compost excess glycerin by-product -- it is non-toxic and biodegrades quickly. It will need to be mixed thoroughly with other materials like sawdust, coconut choirdust etc so that the air and bacteria can get at it, or it will just make a sticky mass -- mix thoroughly to dryness into potting soil.

A note of concern, please don’t just dump glycerin anywhere, it has many uses and DENR prohibits irresponsible throwing of waste in trashes, waterways, dumpsite or sewage. Abide by the environmental and local laws.

## Where do I get the oil?
You can start sourcing with local restaurants, anywhere that fries a lot of food. Chinese restaurants are a great source of oil, be professional and courteous, sometimes it may even be profitable for you to offer to pay them a small amount for their waste oil. Tip: Look for mall fastfood chains and quick service restaurants that are located in strip malls or in places that don’t allow a place for used oil temporary storage or ailse, they are forced into putting the oil back into the containers that it comes in, this makes it easy to get because they are usually throwing it away and you don’t have to pump it.Hotels are also a great source. A small hotel sometimes gives a minimum of 5 by 17 kg pales per week. If you grow big try the food factories and the rejects of oil manufacturers. There are also used cooking oil traders and its easy to find them locally, in yellow pages and in the internet. Caution : be careful of suppliers in tons from Africa. Just check them first before opening an LC.
