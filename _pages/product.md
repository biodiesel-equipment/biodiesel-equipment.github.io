This breakthrough machine can convert in 30 min your used or virgin cooking oils into potent green diesel called BIODIESEL! Clean biodiesel with the following properties:

* No engine modification needed
* Cleans & lubricates your existing engine
* Reduction in smoke and pollution
* Only P6/L operations cost when you’re getting free oil
* Recommended by DOE, DENR and used by DOST
* Produces clear biodiesel at 100% yield equivalent to EURO 5
* Output can be used pure or mix with diesel at any proportions
* No need of water showering

## The Biodiesel Produced

Biodiesel is an alkyl esters derived from the reaction of alcohol with animal or  plants oil. The reaction is called transesterification reaction. This can be achieved by providing the correct reactants, the proper conditions and necessary catalyst for the reaction to take place. Almost all animal and plants oils or the so called triglycerides can be used as feedstock for making biodiesel. Tallow, canola or rapeseed, jatropha, coconut, palm, avocado, peanut, sunflower, castor, olive, shea, mustard, soya, corn etc. are just some examples where biodiesel has been generated through this reaction. The alcohol used on the otherhand can be any alcohol from methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol and so on. Although all of these can provide good biodiesel, one thing that should be  considered in the selection is the economic viability of the alcohol. Methanol being the cheapest and available is an excellent choice. Unlike ethanol, it doesnt form azeotrope or water binding capability that affects the reaction. Methanol may absorbs water, but it can be prevented by mere tight capping of the container. Like any other chemical reactions, many critical factors and conditions should be considered when performing this process. Knowledge of each raw materials and reactants must be in the agenda, should be given quality focus and posted on the wall for easy references. A good example of this is the boiling point of methanol, which is why the temperature during reaction must be maintained at and should not be exceeded.

Here's a sample of grass methyl ester or talahib biodiesel made from grass cutting's oil sourced on idle land in the neighbourhood, in comparison with commercial diesel with 2 % blend and with commercial B100 biodiesel.

Feedstock of biodiesel are derived from renewable, sustainable and biodegradable materials. The figure below illustrates the biodiesel cycle.

To give a short history,this transesterification reaction was first done and patented by Swedish scientists Duffy and Patrick wayback 1853 when gasoline and diesel engines were not yet invented ( source : Grosser, Morton (1978), Diesel: The Man and the Engine, New York: Atheneum, ISBN 978-0-689-30652-5; LCCN 78-006196 ). Thus we can see, that biodiesel is older than its fossil fuel counterpart.Peanut oil was the first oil use by German Engineer Rudolf Diesel in his 1892 diesel engine invention.

Biodiesel has physico-chemical attributes more potent than diesel itself. Unlike diesel, it is non-toxic, biodegradable, renewable fuel, environment friendly, has  higher cetane number, fuel efficient ( Biofuel Phils, 2008 ) and most of all to produce it, it doesn’t need going into war or invading a country. You don’t need to modify your engine to use it. By using it, you likewise contribute to the reduction of the global warming’s threat to humanity. Among the notable positive contributions of biodiesel is its combustibility or the much higher cetane number ( octane rating for gasoline). This is clearly shown in the picture of biodiesel flame as shown in my Flash Flame Test. This is the characteristic zapping, minimal smoke and energy riched flame of talahib biodiesel. Aside from PNS/ASTM specifications, this and actual testing in unmodified diesel engine are part of the quality assurance tests being done to make sure that the final product conforms to standard specifications.

Cetane number of diesel is only 45 while, biodiesel has an average of 68, and the reason for this is,  the oxygen part of the chemical structure of biodiesel where diesel doest have.  We know that for combustion to kindle, oxygen is necessary and for biodiesel, part of the molecule is providing this and not all anymore coming from the air intake of the engine. Some of the benefits of biodiesel are listed below

Biodiesel nomenclature depends on the feedstock used to make it. For instance, a biodiesel made from coconut oil using methanol is called Coco Methyl Ester or CME for short. A biodiesel made from soya oil using ethyl alcohol is therefore called Soya Ethyl Ester or SEE. See biodiesel samples made from different feedstocks below. This includes almost all oils from plants and animals whether used or unused. Even oil and fats removed from our belly in the liposuction process can be converted to biodiesel. The coconut oil used by Philippine army during WWII to replace the depleted diesel inventory is not an  actual biodiesel, but was called cocodiesel. Because glycerol was not reacted out, these 6 X 6 army trucks all bogged down after 6 months of usage due to glycerol clogged nozzles. This is different than the real biodiesel tested by DOST and DOE in actual cars, vans, trucks and buses starting 1972 which became the basis and foundation why Republic Act 9367 or the Biofuels Act of 2006 was enacted.
