Innovation and research were the foundation of CBR Beyond Technology Enterprises. The old slow process of esterification reaction to produce biodiesel from plants and animal oils or otherwise known as triglycerides were revisited, improved and optimized. The objectives of  producing  clear quality biodiesel at 100 % yield and at the fastest reaction time were achieved. This was translated into biodiesel reactors being offered by CBR Beyond Technology Enterprises. 

This was the beginning of the enterprise. Research and development was conducted in the research facilities of Victoria University in Footscray Melbourne Australia 2004. The experimental unit was successfully operated to produced highest quality biodiesel from different animal and plants feedstock at the speed of 30 minutes, clearest quality and at 100 % yield. In the Philippines the machineâ€™s capability was first implemented and realized at Tapa King on August 30, 2008. This momentous event is shown in the picture below and the first biodiesel produced  was tested using an old Mercedez Benz engine also shown.

After this, more than 20 companies and/or individual made used of the reactor and these are shown in the following pictures:

The Enterprises now produces improved CB reactors as shown in the picture below and is likewise fabricating fiberglass equipment like molecular sieve, tank calibrator, FRG oil reservoir and accompanying biodiesel accessories.
